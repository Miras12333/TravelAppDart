Built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete, it is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built and is still the largest standing amphitheater in the world today. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in 72 AD and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus. The Colosseum could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators and was used for gladiatorial contests, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era but later was used for housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine. Although partially ruined due to damage caused by earthquakes and stone-robbers, the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and is listed as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.
